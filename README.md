Burgas Game Jam 2015 - Team Phaser

We are afraid of darkness, but we all came from the dark. Dark is our shelter, in the dark room we are searching for the meaning. Do we need the light? Really? What shall we see in the dawn, will the sunlight save us, or it will blind us? Come and reveal your fears swimming in a fish bowl. Do you really wanna see the wild world?

Our game is 2D, based on PhaserJS library.

Scenario:

The player enters in a dark room. The only light is from a little lighter, with narrow ray of light. Keys are used to direct the light an reveal the objects of the landscape. The objects are a couple of kinds:

Object => passive is : when a hero reaches a passive object, he bounces , the directon is changed randomly...
